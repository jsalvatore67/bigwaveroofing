      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Big Wave Roofing Inc., where craftsmanship meets commitment. Based in the heart of Brevard County at 1007 Pathfinder Way, Suite 100, Rockledge, FL, we are proud to be a locally owned and operated roofing company led by a disabled veteran and former Melbourne, FL roofing inspector. Our team brings unmatched knowledge and genuine care to every project we take on.</p>
      <p>At Big Wave Roofing, our philosophy is simple — treat every roof as if it protects our own home. Unlike high-volume contractors, we choose to focus on fewer projects to deliver exceptional quality and undivided attention. We believe in clear communication, transparency, and doing the job right the first time, every time. As a veteran-led company, integrity, honor, and service are at the core of everything we do.</p>
